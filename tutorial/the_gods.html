<h2>The Gods</h2>

<p>When you begin a game, you will be automatically assigned the role of a certain god. The game will tell you which divine role you have been assigned to. Gods differ from each other mainly in three respects:</p>

<li>Ability to create different types of people (i.e. Warriors, Farmers, and Priests)
<li>Ability to gather the souls of different types of people
<li>The number of points gained for each soul gathered of each type of people

<p>Thus, for example, the Green Lady is able to create a large number of people of any type, but can only gather (and only receives points for) the souls of Farmers, while the Red Lady is unable to create people of any type, can gather souls of any type but is especially good at gathering the souls of Warriors, and receives the most points for Warrior souls. Other gods have different abilities.</p>

<p>To find out your own abilities to create and gather souls, and the number of points you gain for each type of soul, just look at your domain: all this information is displayed clearly there.</p>

<p>Your strategy in the game depends heavily on which god you are, so be sure to choose your actions appropriately to your own characteristics.</p>
