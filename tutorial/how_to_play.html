<h2>How to Play</h2>

<p>The game proceeds in turns. During each turn, each player chooses one action from the options displayed in his/her domain. Once all players have chosen their actions, the results of their actions are resolved, which may result in changes to the game board and / or some players winning points. Play proceeds in this way until 20 turns have been completed. The object of the game is to have as many points as possible at the end of the game.</p>

<h3>Choosing Actions</h3>

<p>Each turn, you must choose one action from the options displayed in your domain. The principal actions available to you at the beginning of the game are:</p>

<li>Create Life: Warriors
<li>Create Life: Farmers
<li>Create Life: Priests
<li>Gather Souls: Warriors
<li>Gather Souls: Farmers
<li>Gather Souls: Priests

<p>There are actually only two different actions, namely Create Life and Gather Souls, but each of them may be chosen to affect any of the three types of people, resulting in six different options.</p>

<p>The number of lives of each type that you may create in one turn depends on which god you are. Similarly, different gods differ in the number of souls of each type that they may gather in one turn. The number of lives of each type that you may create, and the number of souls you may gather, is displayed in your domain.</p>

<h3>Resolving Actions</h3>

<p>Once all players have chosen their actions, the results of their actions will be displayed in the world. In the case of Create Life actions, empty areas of the world will be filled with new life according to the types created. In the case of Gather Souls actions, populated areas of the world will be changed to empty, again according to the types of souls gathered.</p>

<p>If there is not enough empty land to accomodate all the life which the gods attempt to create, or if there is not enough populated land to yield all the souls which the gods attempt to gather, then some actions may have no effect or less than their intended effect. To avoid such inefficiencies, you may wish to coordinate your actions with other players.</p>

<h3>Winning Points</h3>

<p>After all actions are resolved, each player who gathered souls will be awarded a number of points equal to the <b>number</b> of souls gathered multiplied by the number of points that player receives for the <b>type</b> of souls gathered. The latter number is displayed in each player's domain.</p>
