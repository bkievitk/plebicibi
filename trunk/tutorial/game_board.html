<h2>The Game Board</h2>

<p>The game board is divided into several sections. (Graphics will be added to this section when available, but for now it's just text - apologies. Once you see the game in action, it should be clear what each part of this page was referring to.)</p>

<h3>The World</h3>

<p>The space in the center of the game board represents the world. The world is divided into spaces, which represent different geographical areas. The exact location of each space is not important - whether locations are near to or far from each other plays no role in the game.</p>

<h3>People</h3>

<p>Each area of the world may be either empty or populated with people. Its appearance will change to indicate whether it is empty or populated at a given moment. The population (or lack thereof) of each area of the world will change frequently over the course of the game.</p>

<p>Areas of the world may be populated by three different types of people: Warriors, Farmers, and Priests. Each type of people has a distinctive appearance. It should be easy to tell which type of people, if any, are in a given area at a given moment.</p>

<h3>Your Domain</h3>

<p>The area below the world represents your personal domain in the divine realm of the gods - your own slice of heaven.</p>

<p>The most important part of this area is a list of the actions available to you. Each action represents something your divine powers can do to affect the world. Actions are discussed more in the next section, "How to Play".</p>

<p>Eventually, more information will be added to this section, but for now, this is it.</p>

<h3>Other Gods' Domains</h3>

<p>In other parts of the game board surrounding the world, which lies at the center, you will be able to see the domains of the other gods, i.e. the other players. Their domains will contain similar information to yours, but some of their information will not be visible to you.</p>
