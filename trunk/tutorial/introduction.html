<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><i>"As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods - they kill us for their sport."</i>  -- Shakespeare, King Lear</p>

<p>You are a god of the ancient world.  Far below your realm among the stars, the fragile race known as humankind wanders the forests, plains, and mountains of the world.  Sometimes they speak to you, and your brothers and sisters - demanding, cajoling, begging, questioning.  They are right to do so, for their lives are in your hands, to give and to take away.</p>

<p>And yet, you need them too.  Human belief is sweet to the gods, and human souls bring them power. For each human soul that passes into your private part of heaven, you grow stronger, and your status in the heavenly realm rises. Grow your legion of souls carefully, and you may one day aspire to rule over the other gods as they rule over humanity.</p>
